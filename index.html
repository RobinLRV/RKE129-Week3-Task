            <p>Scrambled eggs are a popular breakfast dish and probably one of the first foods many of us ever learned to cook! Simply put, scrambled eggs are whisked eggs, cooked over medium heat in a skillet or frying pan until fluffy and dense. Some people like to add milk or butter when making scrambled eggs.</p>
            <p>To accomplish scrambled eggs, the eggs are traditionally whisked or beaten until the yolks and whites are well mixed. The mixture is then poured into your skillet or frying pan that should be greased to prevent sticking. Stirring the eggs regularly makes them literally scrambled, hence the name! Scrambled eggs are often served hot and eaten right away.</p>

    <div class="container">
        <ul class="list">
            <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
            <li>4 large eggs</li>
            <li>salt</li>
            <li>pepper</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
        <ul class="list2">
            <li>Crack the eggs into a small bowl and whisk together until very well combined. Add salt and pepper. (Start with about 1/4 teaspoon salt.)</li>
            <li>Put a medium-sized nonstick skillet over medium heat and add the butter. Swirl the butter around until melted completely, then reduce the heat to medium low. Add the eggs. Use a spatula to stir the eggs around the pan. It may take a few minutes before the eggs start to form curds. Use the spatula to push and fold the eggs over on themselves, being sure to push the liquidy parts of the egg to make contact with the skillet. Stir frequently. Once the eggs are mainly set but still wet, remove the pan from the heat. Then continue to stir until they are done to your liking*. Serve immediately.</li>
